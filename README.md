Sky Q remote control for sailfish

This is an application to control your Sky Q Box. Commands are sent over wifi so your phone and Sky Q box need to be connected to the same network.

This is wrapping the python pyskyqremote library developed by Roger Selwyn (https://pypi.org/project/pyskyqremote/#description) 
 

Features:
- Automatically detects the ip address of the Sky Q box. 
- Shows details on current media
- Selected buttons available on cover (user configurable)
